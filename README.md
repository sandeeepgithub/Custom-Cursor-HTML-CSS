## Demo

You can view a live demo of the custom cursor [here](link-to-demo).

## Setup

To use the custom cursor on your website, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/custom-cursor.git
   ```

2. Copy the `custom-cursor.css` and `index.html` files into your project directory.

3. Link the `custom-cursor.css` file in your HTML file:

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/custom-cursor.css">
   ```

## Usage

To apply the custom cursor to your website, include the following HTML markup in your `index.html` file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Custom Cursor</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="custom-cursor.css">
</head>
<body>

    <!-- Your website content here -->

    <script src="app.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Ensure that the `custom-cursor.css` file is linked correctly and that your website content is placed within the `<body>` tags.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the custom cursor by modifying the CSS properties in the `custom-cursor.css` file. Adjust the size, shape, color, and other properties to match your website's design.

Here are some customizable properties:

- `cursor-size`: Adjust the size of the cursor.
- `cursor-color`: Change the color of the cursor.
- `cursor-border-radius`: Set the border radius for rounded corners.
- `cursor-custom-shape`: Customize the shape of the cursor.

Feel free to experiment and tailor the cursor style to fit your needs!
